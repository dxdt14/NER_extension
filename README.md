# Explanation

This extension uses the FLERT NER model to find named entities on a webpage and highlight them. Requires connection to a server that I made locally.

# Resources used

Utilized code from https://github.com/oaishi/WikiSearch from the medium article: https://medium.com/@oaishi.faria/connecting-chrome-extension-with-python-backend-912d1d0db26 to help with the creation of this extension

# TODO

Parallelize the NER tagging process to speed up named entity recognition
